# DeepLearningCatBreedProject
Deep Learning image processing classification problem with 4 popular breeds of cats

In this project I tried to use popular techniques of Deep Learning in recognizing images of four cat breeds: Maine Coon, British shorthair, Persian, Bengal. The platfom which I used to test DL models was Google Colab with GPU support.

The simple methods of image processing you can find in cats01 notebook. More advanced techniques with better predictions you will find in cats02.

Dataset contain 1700 images for every breed, in total 6800 images. Data was scrapped by me form Google Images. The scraper that I use you can find in scrapper folder.
