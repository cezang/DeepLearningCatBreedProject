# DeepLearningCatBreedProject
Deep Learning image processing classification problem with 4 popular breeds of cats

In this project I tried to use popular techniques of Deep Learning in recognizing images of four cat breeds: Maine Coon, British shorthair, Persian, Bengal. The platfom which I used to test DL models was Google Colab with GPU support.

Datasets contain 1700 photos of all four breeds. Data was scrapped by me form Google Images. The scraper that I use you can find in scrapper folder.
